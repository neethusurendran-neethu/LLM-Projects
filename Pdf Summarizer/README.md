## Usage

### Starting the Application

#### Method 1: Manual Start (Two Terminal Approach)
1. **Open first terminal** and start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```
   
   Wait until you see the message: `Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000`

2. **Open second terminal** and start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   
   Wait until you see the Streamlit server start message with the local URL

3. **Access the application** by opening your browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8501`

#### Method 2: Automated Start (Script-based)
Create a start script to run both servers automatically:

1. **Create a startup script** (`start.sh`):
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Starting PDF Summarizer backend..."
   cd backend && uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 &
   
   echo "Waiting for backend to start..."
   sleep 10
   
   echo "Starting PDF Summarizer frontend..."
   cd ../frontend && streamlit run app.py &
   
   echo "Both services started. Access the app at http://localhost:8501"
   wait
   ```

2. **Make the script executable and run**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x start.sh
   ./start.sh
   ```

#### Method 3: Using PM2 for Process Management
If you have Node.js and PM2 installed:

1. **Install PM2**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   ```

2. **Create an ecosystem file** (`ecosystem.config.js`):
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     apps: [
       {
         name: 'pdf-summarizer-backend',
         script: './backend/main.py',
         interpreter: 'python',
         args: '-c "import uvicorn; uvicorn.run(\'main:app\', host=\'0.0.0.0\', port=8000)"',
         cwd: './backend'
       },
       {
         name: 'pdf-summarizer-frontend',
         script: './frontend/app.py',
         interpreter: 'python',
         args: '-c "import streamlit.cli; streamlit.cli.main([\'run\', \'app.py\'])"',
         cwd: './frontend'
       }
     ]
   };
   ```

3. **Start both applications**:
   ```bash
   pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
   pm2 status  # Check if both processes are running
   ```

### Interacting with the Application

#### Basic Usage
1. **Upload a PDF file** using the "Browse files" button in the Streamlit interface
2. **Wait for processing** - You'll see a "Summarizing..." spinner during processing
3. **Review the summary** once it appears in the output area
4. **Copy the summary** if needed using your browser's copy functionality

#### Advanced Usage Tips
- **File Size**: For optimal performance, use PDFs under 10MB
- **Document Types**: Works best with text-based documents (not scanned images)
- **Processing Time**: Large documents may take 30-60 seconds to process
- **Quality**: Summaries of academic or technical documents may require careful review

### Command Line Usage (Direct API Access)
The backend API can also be used directly without the frontend:

1. **Test the API endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/docs"  # View API documentation
   ```

2. **Direct PDF summarization**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/summarize/" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "file=@your_document.pdf"
   ```

3. **Python script integration**:
   ```python
   import requests
   
   def summarize_pdf(pdf_path):
       with open(pdf_path, 'rb') as pdf_file:
           files = {'file': pdf_file}
           response = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/summarize/', files=files)
           return response.json()
   
   result = summarize_pdf('document.pdf')
   print(result['summary'])
   ```

### Stopping the Application
- **For uvicorn**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running the backend
- **For Streamlit**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running the frontend
- **For PM2**: Use `pm2 stop all` or `pm2 delete all` to stop permanently

### Troubleshooting Common Issues
- **Port already in use**: Change ports in the start commands
- **Model loading timeout**: First run may take 2-3 minutes to download the model
- **Memory issues**: Close other applications to free up RAM
- **CORS errors**: Ensure both frontend and backend are running

## How It Works

### Detailed Process Flow

1. **Frontend File Upload** (Streamlit Interface):
   - User selects a PDF file using the Streamlit file uploader component
   - The file is held in memory temporarily without being saved to disk
   - UI displays loading spinner during processing
   - JavaScript-driven progress indicator provides visual feedback

2. **HTTP Request Formation**:
   - Streamlit frontend constructs a multipart form data request
   - The PDF binary data is packaged with appropriate headers
   - Request is sent to the FastAPI backend at `http://localhost:8000/summarize/`
   - Connection uses standard HTTP POST method with proper content-type

3. **Backend Request Handling** (FastAPI):
   - FastAPI's UploadFile type handles the incoming PDF file
   - File validation occurs to ensure PDF format
   - Memory buffering is used to prevent disk I/O overhead
   - Request routing and parameter validation using Pydantic models

4. **PDF Text Extraction** (PyPDF2):
   - `PyPDF2.PdfReader()` creates a reader object for the uploaded file
   - Iterates through all PDF pages using `pdf_reader.pages`
   - Extracts text content using `page.extract_text()` method
   - Handles potential empty pages and malformed content gracefully
   - Combines text from all pages into a single string variable

5. **Text Preprocessing & Chunking**:
   - System checks if extracted text is empty or contains only whitespace
   - Large documents are chunked into 1000-character segments to fit model constraints
   - Chunking algorithm preserves sentence boundaries when possible
   - Overlap between chunks is avoided to prevent redundancy

6. **AI Model Initialization**:
   - Hugging Face pipeline is initialized with `"summarization"` task
   - Model `"facebook/bart-large-cnn"` is loaded from Hugging Face Hub
   - Tokenizer and model weights are cached for subsequent requests
   - GPU usage is automatically configured if available (CPU used by default)

7. **BART Model Processing**:
   - Each text chunk is processed through the BART model
   - Summarization parameters: `max_length=130`, `min_length=30`, `do_sample=False`
   - Model applies attention mechanisms to identify key information
   - Generative process creates abstractive summaries rather than extractive ones
   - Multiple chunks are processed sequentially to maintain context

8. **Summary Aggregation**:
   - Individual chunk summaries are concatenated with space separators
   - Redundant information is implicitly reduced through the model's focus
   - Final summary is cleaned and stripped of excess whitespace
   - Quality checks ensure coherent, readable output

9. **Response Generation**:
   - Summarized content is packaged in JSON format
   - HTTP response with appropriate headers and status code is constructed
   - Response is sent back to the Streamlit frontend
   - Backend logs processing metrics for monitoring

10. **Frontend Display**:
    - Streamlit receives the JSON response containing the summary
    - Summary is displayed in a formatted text area
    - Success message with processing time is shown to the user
    - Copy functionality is available for the generated summary

### Model Architecture Details

The application utilizes the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model which implements:

- **BART Architecture**: Transformer-based denoising autoencoder with bidirectional (BERT-like) encoder and left-to-right decoder
- **Pre-training Tasks**: Trained on document-level tasks using text infilling and sentence permutation
- **Fine-tuning**: Specifically fine-tuned on CNN/Daily Mail news datasets for abstractive summarization
- **Model Size**: Large variant with 12 encoder and 12 decoder layers (406M parameters)
- **Context Window**: Can handle sequences up to 1024 tokens, necessitating chunking for longer documents

### Summarization Parameters Explained
- `max_length=130`: Maximum number of tokens in the generated summary (controls summary length)
- `min_length=30`: Minimum number of tokens to ensure meaningful content
- `do_sample=False`: Uses greedy decoding (deterministic output) rather than sampling
- `truncation=True`: Automatically truncates input to model's maximum context length
- `pad_token_id`: Ensures proper padding for batch processing

## Processing Workflow and Implementation Details

- Manages page-level text extraction with encoding normalization
- Applies error handling for malformed or password-protected PDFs

#### Stage 3: Content Extraction and Cleaning
- Extracts raw text from each page while preserving document structure
- Handles special characters, mathematical symbols, and formatting
- Removes extraneous whitespace and line breaks for cleaner input
- Validates extracted text quality and length

#### Stage 4: Text Chunking Algorithm
- Implements dynamic chunking based on character limits (1000 chars)
- Preserves sentence boundaries when possible to maintain context
- Implements intelligent splitting to avoid breaking important content
- Tracks chunk positions for potential reassembly if needed

#### Stage 5: AI Model Processing
- Loads the pre-trained BART model into memory for efficient reuse
- Processes each text chunk through the summarization pipeline
- Applies appropriate hyperparameters for optimal summarization
- Manages memory usage during sequential processing

#### Stage 6: Output Aggregation
- Combines individual chunk summaries into a cohesive document
- Removes redundant information that may appear across chunks
- Ensures logical flow and readability in the final output
- Formats the result for consistent presentation

- **Startup Time**: ~30-60 seconds (including model loading)
- **First Summarization**: 30-120 seconds (model loading + processing)
- **Subsequent Summarizations**: 10-60 seconds (depending on document size)
- **Memory Usage**: 2-4 GB RAM when model is loaded
- **CPU Usage**: High during processing, minimal otherwise

#### Accuracy Metrics
The BART model performance is based on established benchmarks:
- **ROUGE-1 Score**: ~44.16 (measures content overlap)
- **ROUGE-2 Score**: ~20.19 (measures bigram overlap)
- **ROUGE-L Score**: ~39.48 (measures longest common subsequence)

### Testing Scenarios

#### Document Type Testing
- **Academic Papers**: Well-structured content with clear sections
- **News Articles**: Good performance on factual content
- **Technical Manuals**: May require validation of technical accuracy
- **Mixed Content**: Text with figures, tables, and equations
- **Multi-language Docs**: Performance varies based on training data

#### Edge Case Testing
- **Empty PDFs**: Application returns appropriate error message
- **Password-protected PDFs**: Proper error handling
- **Scanned Images**: Limited or no text extraction
- **Very Large Files**: Chunking handles large documents
- **Malformed PDFs**: Graceful error handling

### Quality Assurance Procedures

#### Before Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Model loads successfully without errors
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Frontend communicates properly with backend
- [ ] Error handling works for invalid inputs
- [ ] Summarization quality meets expectations
- [ ] Memory usage is within acceptable limits
- [ ] Processing times are reasonable

#### Performance Testing
1. **Load Testing**: Simulate multiple concurrent users
2. **Stress Testing**: Test with large files to identify limits
3. **Memory Profiling**: Monitor memory usage during processing
4. **Response Time Monitoring**: Track API response times

#### Validation Testing
1. **Summary Coherence**: Verify summaries make logical sense
2. **Content Preservation**: Ensure key information isn't lost
3. **Factual Accuracy**: Check that summaries don't introduce false information
4. **Readability**: Assess if summaries are easily understandable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Model Loading Time**: The first run may take longer as the BART model is downloaded and loaded
2. **Large Files**: Very large PDFs may take more processing time
3. **Memory Usage**: Large documents may require significant memory for processing
4. **Network Issues**: Initial model download requires stable internet connection
5. **Port Conflicts**: Ensure ports 8000 and 8501 are available

### Solutions:
1. Ensure sufficient memory is available when processing large documents
2. For very large documents, consider pre-processing to extract relevant sections
3. Check network connectivity for initial model download
4. Restart services if they become unresponsive
5. Use different ports if current ones are in use: `uvicorn main:app --port 8001`

### Advanced Troubleshooting:
#### Backend Issues
- Check logs: `tail -f backend.log` (if logging to file)
- Verify dependencies: `pip list | grep -E "(fastapi|transformers|torch)"`
- Test model loading separately: `python -c "from transformers import pipeline; p = pipeline('summarization', model='facebook/bart-large-cnn'); print('Model loaded successfully')"`

#### Frontend Issues
- Verify backend connection: `curl http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Check Streamlit logs for errors
- Ensure proper CORS settings if accessing from different domain
- Clear browser cache if interface appears broken

### Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# Check if backend server is running
curl -I http://localhost:8000/

# Check if frontend server is running
curl -I http://localhost:8501/

# Monitor system resources during processing
htop  # or top

# Check network connectivity
netstat -tulpn | grep :8000  # Check backend port
netstat -tulpn | grep :8501  # Check frontend port
```

## Performance Considerations

- The application processes documents in chunks of 1000 characters
- Summarization time increases with document size
- Memory usage scales with document length
- The first summarization may be slower due to model loading

## Extensibility

The architecture supports:
- Integration with different summarization models
- Additional file format support (e.g., DOCX, TXT)
- Batch processing of multiple documents
- Export options for summaries
- Custom summarization parameters
